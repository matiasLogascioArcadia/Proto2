Write a JavaScript function that loops through the `kpis` object and generates each row of the table.

Structure:
- For each section (e.g., partA, partB), iterate over each KPI
- Extract: category, label, value, mom, yoy, direction
- Render each as a row using the layout from Prompt_25_2
- Order of sections: membersSeen, coding, partA, partB, partD
