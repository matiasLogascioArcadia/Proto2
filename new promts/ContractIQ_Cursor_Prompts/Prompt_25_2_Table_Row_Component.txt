Create a reusable row layout for each KPI in the summary table.

Each row should contain:
- Category (e.g., Part A, Coding, etc.)
- Metric label (e.g., RAF Score)
- Value (bold)
- MoM with arrow and colored text (green for ▲, red for ▼)
- YoY with arrow and colored text (green for ▲, red for ▼)

Use Tailwind utility classes:
- Value: `text-gray-900 font-semibold`
- Trend positive: `text-green-600`, arrow: ▲
- Trend negative: `text-red-600`, arrow: ▼
