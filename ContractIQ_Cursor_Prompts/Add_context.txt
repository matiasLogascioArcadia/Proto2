I am building a front-end-only prototype of a healthcare contract dashboard called Contract IQ. It has 3 levels:

1. Contract View: shows all contracts with KPIs like member months, expenses, surplus.
2. Provider View: shows performance by TIN, NPI, or Practice, with quality gap metrics.
3. PCP Panel: shows top members by clinical risk flags (e.g., suspect conditions, polypharmacy).

There is no backend â€” data comes from local JSON files. The UI is built in HTML, JavaScript (vanilla modules), and Tailwind CSS.

I will provide instructions in prompt files one by one and expect Cursor to generate or modify the appropriate code.
