Create a `providers.json` file with 3 sample views:
- TINs
- NPIs
- Practices

Each provider object should have:
- unit_type ("TIN", "NPI", "Practice")
- unit_name
- target
- expense
- surplus
- quality_gaps_total
- quality_gaps_completed
- member_months

Make sure some units have negative surplus or low % quality completion.
