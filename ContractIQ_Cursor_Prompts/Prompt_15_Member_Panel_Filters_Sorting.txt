Add filters and sorting to MemberPanel.js:

- Dropdown or buttons to filter by category (e.g. Suspect Conditions, Frequent Flyers)
- Sort options: by metric_value (e.g., visits, cost)
- Show a count of members in each section

Use Tailwind: `select`, `rounded`, `text-sm`, and `grid-cols` for responsive layout.
