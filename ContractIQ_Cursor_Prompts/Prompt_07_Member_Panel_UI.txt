Create a `MemberPanel.js` component that:
- Loads `members.json`
- Groups members into 6 cards:
  - Suspect Conditions
  - Frequent Flyers
  - High Utilizers
  - Polypharmacy
  - Pharmacy Cost
  - Specialty Cost

Each card shows:
- Top 10 members
- Name, metric value, and PCP
- Action button: “View Member”

Use `grid-cols-2` or `flex-wrap`, with `bg-white`, `rounded-xl`, `shadow`, and section titles.
Include top nav showing:
"Viewing: Contract A > Unit: TIN 123456 > Panel Type: PCP"
