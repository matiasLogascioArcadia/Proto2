Build a `ProviderTable.js` component that:
- Loads and displays `providers.json`
- Adds a selector: [ TIN | NPI | Practice ]
- Filters data based on selected unit_type
- Displays table with:
  - Name
  - Member Months
  - Target
  - Expense
  - Surplus
  - % Gaps Completed
  - Total Gaps
  - Buttons: “Go to Panel” + “Quality Gaps”

Use Tailwind: `bg-white`, `shadow-md`, `text-gray-800`, `hover:bg-gray-100`.
Add sorting on surplus, gaps, members.
