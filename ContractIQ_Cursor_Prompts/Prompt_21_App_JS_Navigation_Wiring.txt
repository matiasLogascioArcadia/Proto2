In app.js, wire together all components:

- Start with ContractTable on load
- Clicking “View by TIN/NPI/Practice” hides contract view and shows ProviderTable
- Clicking “Go to Panel” shows MemberPanel with breadcrumbs updated
- Clicking “View Quality Gaps” opens QualityModal

Use `section.classList.add("hidden")` and `classList.remove("hidden")` to toggle visibility.
